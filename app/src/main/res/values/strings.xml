The app also enables citizens report crimes , accidents and emergencies to the central database which can be accessed by govt. Officials.

The app also provides flash card and first aid instructions for situations such as drowning, electricution etc.
        The user can take photo of accidents and other emergency situations and share it with family and friends who might be able to help them. A copy of their location is updated to the central server.</string>

<string name="ab">In India, where there is currently a very unorganised and distributed emergency services system , with different states having different helplines for medical criminal or arson emergencies, an app which integrates all of them together under one quick, responsive and easy to use app.

(Many cities have 100 facility but most of them have very poor response time and sometimes no respone at all)

    Having a integrated app ensures that their concerns are addressed to the authorities.</string>

<string name ="About">Reliable, better response time, informative, multiplatform integration.</string>
